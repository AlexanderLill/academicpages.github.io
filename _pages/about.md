Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is Alexander Lill, and I am a research assistant and Ph.D. student at the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab (HASEL) at the University of Zurich (UZH).

Please use the links in the sidebar to checkout my profile on other websites, such as my LinkedIn for a detailed CV, Google Scholar for my publications, or my HASEL website for everything related to my research and teaching / supervision.
